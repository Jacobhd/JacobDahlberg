          p I identify as non-binary, my prounouns he/them. I am empathetic, communicate clearly, and love to take feedback and run with it. I am always learning, whether it's about systemic racism or a coding language. I believe mental wellness is very important, and can often be found reading, camping, playing music, or spending time with family and friends. My interests in tech are web design, data storage, and cybersecurity. Outside of tech I love science and my partner often finds me in the middle of the most recent article on planitary science, ecology, or geography. I also love to read about how history has affected our current world.
          p Born on the Oregon Coast, I love to travel and sit with nature, particularly with my partner and our two dogs. Previously a full time musician, I am currently reskilling to persue my passions in technology. Watching how internet access can benefit, educate, and empower those with access opened my eyes to those who have been denied access due to disability, socioeconomic status, or government censorship. Web accessability and access to information is such a powerful tool that I believe everyone should have access to. Whether it's maintaining education platforms that teach computer literacy and beginner programing, creating responsive UI/UX that take into account the end user, or managing, compiling, and analyzing large chuncks of scientific data, I want to be involved in changing the status quo in our country and our world.
